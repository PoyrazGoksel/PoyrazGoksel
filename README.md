**Unity Developer** | **R&D Specialist** | **Systems Architect**\
I'm a seasoned Unity C# developer with 6 years of experience working at top game studios and independently on mobile games.\
I've led development teams, built modular and optimized architectures, and always aimed to merge technical excellence with creative gameplay.

Iâ€™m particularly passionate about:

- Procedural Systems & Gameplay Loops
- Game Architecture (Zenject, MV/VM, MVC)
- Shader Programming (HLSL / Cg / Amplify Shader)
- AI Behaviors & Combat Logic
- Custom Tools and Editor Extensions
- Mobile Game Optimization & Publishing
